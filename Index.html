	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>Name</h2>
		<p>My name is Salima Fong-Pien-Joe. I was named after family members. My biological dad's name was Salim and because my biological parents are great at making up names they decided to add an 'a'. My last name is Chinese, because of my granddad. </p>
	<h2>Age</h2>
		<p>I am currently 17 years old. That means I can't legally drink yet. That's basically all there is to it. It's my age, there's honestly not a lot to it.</p>
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p><ul> <li>Listening to music</li>
				<li>Playing cello</li>
				<li>Gaming</li>
				<li>Eating sweets</li>
				<li>Watching anime</li>
				<li>Petting my dog</li>
		</ul></p>
	<h2>Software Development</h2>
		<p>I didn't know what I wanted to study for the longest time. I had been trying to figure out my future to no avail for years. The only thing I was somewhat good as was English and my dean recommended the ICT section to me. Mostly because I liked gaming, english and I wanted to work in the gaming industry. At first I didn't think it would be something I could enjoy but after doing more research I thought it could become something I would learn to love. Kind of like having your hobby as your job. After trying it I got really excited. I like being able to both work alone and in groups and I feel like it's the best of both worlds here. I also like being able to see the results of everything I do, so that was another selling point for me. We're a week in now, and I'm glad I chose Software Development. Of course I can't say for sure that I will continue to enjoy it, but I really feel at home at school for the first time in a long period of my life. </p>
